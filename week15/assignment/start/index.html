        <p>For my final project, I decided to iterate and expand on assignment 11.A. Using the sketches I had made based on the principles of Form + Code as a jumping off point, I created three unique sketches. All three sketches required research to incorporate p5 techniques I had not previously explored. In terms of computational aesthetics, repetition and simulation make the most visible appearance in my sketches. The most essential criterion in executing these sketches was the addition of interaction. I laid out the requirement that each sketch must be dynamic and require user input to generate visual interest.</p>
